## About me

Hello world! I'm Lera, beginner web-developer.
I'm obsessed with idea to contribute to the web by creating responsive, accessible and enjoyable apps. My personal passion is beautiful animations in pure CSS, one day I want to be able to make my own ideal one.

### My strengths

- to be detail-oriented that means being able to pay close attention and notice minor details;
- ability to switch between tasks quickly or focusing on two or more objectives;
- learnability and a great desire to learn;
- sense of humor (hepls to deal with any kind of difficulties).

In my free time I am fond of clay modeling, anthropological stories of different nationalities, ecotourism, birdwatching and art of the 20th century.
